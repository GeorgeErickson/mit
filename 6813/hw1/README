The build directory is probably what you care about


# Code Layout
The src directory contains the code I have written in three separate parts
1. Less -> compiles to build/base.css (also includes Twitter Bootstrap library)
2. Jade -> compiles to build/translate_game.html
3. coffee -> compiles to build/translate_game.js

# Development Requirements - talk to george(george@kyru.us) if you need help
1. node.js (brew install node)
2. npm (currently comes with node)
3. less (npm install -g less)
4. jade (npm install -g jade)
5. coffeescript (npm install -g coffee-script)
6. watchr (sudo gem install watchr)

# Developing
1. Run "watchr watch.rb" from main project directory
2. Edit files - on save the generated output will be created
3. If you add a new file you have to restart the watchr script
